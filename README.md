## Commands

**/formula-ocr**: returns the LaTex code of the image in the clipboard

> **Notes**: 
> + The image in the clipboard must be a LaTex formula image
> + The initial command may be delayed for about 1 minute due to the loading of the model in Hugging Face or when not used for a long time
> + With the free Hugging Face plan you can make about 30k calls per month (more than enough I would say)
